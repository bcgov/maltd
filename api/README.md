# User Secrets
In development mode, sensitive credentials can be used without adding to a configuration file that may accidently added 
to source control. See [Safe storage of app secrets in development in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=windows)
for more information.  User secrets are only used for local development. At present, no secrets are required.
